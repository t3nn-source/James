                                <p>Boof has been on an absolutely historic run in 2024. I mean come on,
                                    the banger of a track that Hey big head was early in the year, combined with
                                    the steady pace he has kept has just been beautiful, all the snippets 
                                    and beautiful tracks, just a majestic mix of sounds!

                            <section>
                                This album has a great mix of spacey beats and showcases Boof's unique flows and style.
                                    Trying to make a list of the best songs on this 12 track tape proves foolish, as every one 
                                    of these songs are great and are well worth the listen.
                                    
                                    If you only have a few to listen to this album, then I would say these are my favorite tracks.
